# 1. The Problem–Lens–Format Framework (Most Practical)

This is the simplest and most reliable.

### Step 1 — Pick a Domain

Example:

* Sales
* Leadership
* Cybersecurity
* Career growth
* Engineering management

### Step 2 — Apply Lenses

Ask: “What angle can we look at this from?”

Common lenses:

* Decisions
* Mistakes
* Priorities
* Tools
* Metrics
* Stakeholders
* Processes
* Career growth
* Psychology
* Economics
* Communication
* Failure scenarios
* AI usage
* Strategy
* Execution

### Step 3 — Pick a Format

Examples:

* Question book
* Checklist
* Prompt pack
* Email course
* Battle cards
* Playbook
* Templates
* Assessments
* Simulations

### Step 4 — Combine

Formula:

> Domain + Lens + Format = Product Idea

Example:

Engineering Manager + Decisions + Question Book
→ “Think Like an Engineering Manager”

This is exactly what you did.

# 2. The Role × Situation Matrix

Very powerful for professional audiences.

Create a grid:

| Role                | Situation   |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| Product Manager     | Crisis      |
| Sales Leader        | Forecasting |
| Engineering Manager | Hiring      |
| Founder             | Fundraising |
| CFO                 | Budget Cuts |

Each cell can become a product.

Formula:

> Role + Situation + Perspective = Idea

Example:

CFO + Budget Cuts + Checklist
→ “Surviving Budget Cuts: CFO Decision Checklist”

This framework generates **hundreds of ideas quickly**.

---

# 3. The Pain Stack Decomposition Method

Break down pain into layers.

Every professional problem has 5 layers:

1. Awareness problem
2. Knowledge problem
3. Decision problem
4. Execution problem
5. Confidence problem

You can build products at each layer.

Example topic: Negotiation

* Awareness → “Are You Negotiating Wrong?” assessment
* Knowledge → Negotiation principles guide
* Decision → Negotiation scenario question book
* Execution → Negotiation scripts templates
* Confidence → Simulation exercises

This ensures you don’t create shallow products.

---

# 4. The Before–During–After Journey Framework

Great for workflows and processes.

Pick any activity:

Example: Hiring

Break into phases:

Before → During → After

Products:

* Before → Hiring preparation checklist
* During → Interview question bank
* After → Candidate evaluation templates

Formula:

> Activity Stage + Role = Product

This works extremely well for B2B audiences.

---

# 5. The Cognitive Load Mapping Framework (High Value)

Ask:

Where does thinking become hard?

Digital products that reduce thinking load sell well.

Look for:

* Ambiguity
* Uncertainty
* Risk
* Tradeoffs
* Complexity
* Time pressure

Example:

Incident response is hard → create decision frameworks.

Formula:

> High cognitive load zone → Support artifact

---

# 6. The Mistake Mining Framework

Ask professionals:

* What mistakes do people make?
* What do beginners get wrong?
* What do leaders regret?
* What causes failure?

Each mistake cluster can become a product.

Example:

Startup mistakes → “Startup Founder Failure Checklist”

Mistake-driven products perform very well.

---

# 7. The Invisible Knowledge Extraction Framework

Find knowledge that exists but isn’t documented.

Examples:

* Mental models
* Decision heuristics
* Tradeoffs
* Political realities
* Stakeholder psychology
* War stories

Turn invisible expertise into structured artifacts.

This is extremely valuable.

Your role-perspective idea fits here.

---

# 8. The Constraint Flip Framework

Take a constraint and turn it into a product.

Examples:

* No budget
* Small team
* Tight deadlines
* New role
* No experience
* Crisis situation

Example:

“No budget marketing” → product idea.

Formula:

> Constraint + Outcome = Product

---

# 9. The Perspective Shift Framework

Take the same topic but change viewpoint.

Example topic: Product roadmap

Perspectives:

* CFO view
* Customer view
* Engineering view
* CEO view
* Investor view

Each perspective can become a product.

This is powerful and underused.

---

# 10. The Artifact Conversion Framework (Very Practical)

Look at what professionals already create manually:

* Spreadsheets
* Docs
* Checklists
* Slides
* Templates
* Notes
* Email drafts

Turn them into products.

Example:

Sales discovery notes → discovery framework product.

Most successful info products come from this.

---

# 11. The Frequency × Pain × Urgency Scoring Model

Evaluate ideas using 3 variables:

1. Frequency — How often problem occurs?
2. Pain — How painful is it?
3. Urgency — Do they need solution now?

High scores → good product.

Example:

Promotion into management → high score.

---

# 12. The Decision Support Framework (Premium Ideas)

Ask:

What decisions do people struggle with?

Examples:

* Should we hire?
* Should we pivot?
* Should we fire?
* Should we buy tool?
* Should we enter market?

Decision support products are high value.

Formula:

> Decision + Role = Product

---

# 13. The Role Evolution Framework (Future-Oriented)

Ask:

How is this role changing?

Examples:

* AI impact
* Remote work
* Automation
* Regulation
* Market shifts

Create products helping people adapt.

Example:

“AI Survival Guide for QA Engineers”

---

# 14. The Outcome Reverse Engineering Framework

Start with desired outcome:

Examples:

* Promotion
* Better performance
* More revenue
* Faster growth
* Better decisions
* Less stress

Then ask:

What knowledge artifact helps achieve this?

---

# 15. The Idea Generator Formula (Meta Framework)

You can combine everything into one master formula:

> Audience + Problem + Situation + Lens + Format + Outcome

Example:

Engineering Managers + Hiring + First 90 Days + Decisions + Checklist + Avoid Mistakes
→ Product idea.

---

# 16. A Repeatable Ideation Process You Can Follow

Here is a practical workflow.

Step 1 — Choose Audience
Example: Engineering managers

Step 2 — List Situations

* Hiring
* Promotion
* Crisis
* Performance reviews
* Planning

Step 3 — List Lenses

* Decisions
* Mistakes
* Tools
* Metrics
* Psychology
* Stakeholders

Step 4 — List Formats

* Questions
* Checklists
* Prompts
* Email course
* Battle cards

Step 5 — Combine randomly

You’ll generate dozens of ideas quickly.

# 17. Advanced — Your Natural Advantage

Based on your background (structured thinking, frameworks, GTM, IR, consulting), your strongest categories are:

* Role intelligence
* Decision frameworks
* Scenario simulations
* Readiness assessments
* Cross-functional thinking tools
* AI prompt artifacts

Those have premium positioning.

---

# 18. Common Mistakes in Digital Product Ideation

Avoid:

* Generic topics
* No clear audience
* No specific situation
* No measurable outcome
* Too broad scope
* No urgency

Specific beats broad.
